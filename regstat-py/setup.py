"""Build the shared covariance-change C back-end at INSTALL time.

The package previously shelled out to `cc` on FIRST IMPORT and wrote the resulting library into its
own site-packages directory. That works on the author's machine and fails everywhere else: it needs a
compiler at import rather than install, so the failure surfaces as a crash instead of an install
error; it writes into site-packages, which is read-only in containers and many system installs; and
it hardcoded `cc`, which stock Windows does not have. This is the same correction 'arcstat' received
before its release, and it is made here for the same reason.

Declaring the sources as an Extension hands the compile to pip, inside build isolation, at the point
where a missing compiler is a clear install-time error -- and lets real platform wheels be built,
after which users need no compiler at all.

init.c is excluded deliberately: it is R's symbol-registration glue, it references R headers, and it
is not part of the Python front. It is not currently synced into this tree, and the filter is here so
that it stays harmless if it ever is.
